# Minicraft :: Dwarves
Let's put Minicraft and Dwarf Fortress together and see what happens!

This code is a fork of the vanilla Minicraft code - originally by Notch (http://notch.tumblr.com/) for the Ludum Dare 22 competition.
The first thing added was the save-n-load feature (which is available as a separate branch to keep it clean).
The next goal is to add more complex crafting and building options and some NPCs (villages etc.).
